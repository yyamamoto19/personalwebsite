<h2 id="two">How It Works</h2>
<p1>
Callisto was developed with the insight and input of over 100 college survivors, as well as experts in the fields of trauma, sexual assault prevention, data security, web accessibility, and legal compliance.

Callisto is a survivor-centered tool that creates a safe and supportive online space for students to learn about and report sexual assault without pressures or judgement.

We believe that survivors can be empowered to make the decisions that are right for them if they know their options, understand the process, and have agency over how their story is shared. Callisto is based on the understanding that every survivor is different, as are their experiences, reactions, and needs.
